# SQL Query Optimization Report

## Objective:
To analyze the performance of the SQL query that retrieves all bookings along with user details, property details, and payment details, and to identify any inefficiencies. The goal is to optimize the query for faster performance by using indexing and query refactoring.

---

## Original Query

The original query retrieves all bookings and joins the `User`, `Property`, and `Payment` tables:

```sql
-- Original query to retrieve all bookings with user details, property details, and payment details
SELECT 
    Booking.booking_id,
    Booking.start_date,
    Booking.end_date,
    Booking.total_price AS booking_total_price,
    Booking.status AS booking_status,
    User.user_id,
    User.first_name AS user_first_name,
    User.last_name AS user_last_name,
    User.email AS user_email,
    Property.property_id,
    Property.name AS property_name,
    Property.location AS property_location,
    Property.pricepernight AS property_price_per_night,
    Payment.payment_id,
    Payment.amount AS payment_amount,
    Payment.payment_method AS payment_method,
    Payment.payment_date AS payment_date
FROM 
    Booking
JOIN 
    User ON Booking.user_id = User.user_id
JOIN 
    Property ON Booking.property_id = Property.property_id
JOIN 
    Payment ON Booking.booking_id = Payment.booking_id;
